How I update the GitHub pages for my projects with Sphinx documentation

Here are the steps I follow (only slight difference from github's):

1. build the Sphinx docs in the project locally
2. copy the *html* directory contents somewhere else
3. switch to the *gh-pages* branch
4. remove all git content
5. copy contents of that *html* dir back to the branch
6. commit all the new files
7. push to github
8. switch back to the *master* branch

.. tip::  The instructions to publish User & Organization Pages
   are shorter and simpler. [#]_
   "Content from the ``master`` branch will be used to build 
   and publish your GitHub Pages site."
   This means the HTML is published on the ``master`` branch, alongside 
   any source code such as ``.rst``) for the page(s).
   
   For a Sphinx build, these are the steps I use to publish the user docs page::

     make clean html
     pushd _build/html/
     tar cf - . | (cd ../.. && tar xf -)
     popd
     git add .
   
   and then push to the ``origin master``.

build the Sphinx docs in the project locally
--------------------------------------------
for my projects, the docs are in the "docs" subdirectory::

	$ cd docs
	$ make clean

Before proceeding to build the html pages, it is useful to make a 
modification [#]_ to the Sphinx Makefile so that GitHub 
pages will not try to render the pages using jekyll.  Without this, 
the Sphinx document theme will not be able to make the pages look 
right.  With this modification in place, proceed to build the html 
documentation::

	$ make html

.. [#] add ``.nojekyll`` file to HTML directory root
   (`example <https://github.com/prjemian/prjemian.github.io/commit/4b2bddc61a6e294ae8df2b094e6966e4b899d8d6>`_) 

copy the *html* directory contents somewhere else
-------------------------------------------------

I use *tar*, it is simple (proceeding from previous point)::

	$ cd build/html
	$ tar czf /tmp/html.tgz .

switch to the *gh-pages* branch
-------------------------------
first, move back to the project's root directory::

    $ cd ../../..

If the project does not have a *gh-pages* branch, it should be created
with the special command::

    $ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
	Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'

You only need to do this once per project.  
Check https://github.com/prjemian/cmd_response [#]_ under branches and 
it will tell you if such a branch exists.  For *cmd_response*, that exists.
If the *gh-pages* branch exists, just use this command::

	$ git checkout gh-pages
	Branch gh-pages set up to track remote branch gh-pages from origin.

.. [#] the general pattern for the project URL is:
   https://github.com/<username>/<projectname>
   
   The docs will be published to:
   http://<username>.github.io/<projectname>

remove all git content
----------------------

Confirm you are on the gh-pages branch if you need the confidence builder::

	$ git branch
	* gh-pages
	  master

The "*" confirms the *gh-pages* branch is checked out now.

This next command looks dangerous.  Fear not.
It just cleans out the project content from
the documentation branch::

	$ git rm -rf .
	rm '.buildinfo'
	rm '.nojekyll'
	rm '_modules/index.html'
	...
	
All that should remain is the *.git* directory.  Don't delete that!

At this point, there may remain some other files and directories that
were not in git version control.  These need to be deleted directly
(not with git but with normal delete commands).  Check for them.  
Likely ones include docs, dist, build, perhaps others.  For me::

	$ ls -lAFg
	total 12
	drwxr-xr-x 3 mint14 4096 Mar 24 20:30 docs/
	drwxr-xr-x 8 mint14 4096 Mar 24 20:30 .git/
	$ /bin/rm -rf docs
	$ ls -lAFg
	total 4
	drwxr-xr-x 8 mint14 4096 Mar 24 20:30 .git/

All that should remain *now* is the *.git* directory.

copy contents of that html dir back to the branch
-------------------------------------------------

We used tar before to copy our documentation.  We bring it back now::

    $ tar xzf /tmp/html.tgz

commit all the new files
------------------------

Put all the new documentation into git version control::

	$ git add .
	$ git commit -a -m "publish the docs"

push to github
--------------

The changes are not published until you push the changeset back to github::

    $ git push origin gh-pages

and enter credentials as requested.  Your documentation should
appear at http://prjemian.github.io/cmd_response right away if they 
have already been posted before.  For a brand new project, it might
take up to 10 minutes.

switch back to the *master* branch
----------------------------------

Don't forget to switch your working directory back to the *master*
(or other) branch once you have successfully pushed the docs::

    $ git checkout master
